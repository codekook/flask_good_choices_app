# Good Choices Web App

![image of Good Choices logo.](/flask_package/static/img/IMG_1102.jpeg)

## Overview

- **Controller: Python/Flask**
- **Model: Sqlite/Sqlalchemy**
- **View: HTML/CSS/Jinja**

My first web application is built using the classic model, view, controller construct and is hosted on Heroku.  The purpose of the app is to create a simple tool for tracking chores getting completed around the house and providing immediate positive feedback when they're finished.  There are more features and testing I look forward to adding, but for now this is a good start.  

## Features

- Register
- Login/Logout
- Site Feedback
- Add/Delete Chores
- Complete Chores
- Reset Chores

## Other important tools
