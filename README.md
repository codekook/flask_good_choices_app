## Overview

- **Controller: Python/Flask**
- **Model: mySql/Sqlalchemy**
- **View: HTML/CSS/Jinja**
- **Testing: Pytest**

My first web application is built using the classic model, view, controller construct and is hosted on PythonAnywhere.  The purpose of the app is to create a simple tool for tracking chores getting completed around the house and providing immediate positive feedback when they're finished.  The app was originally called Good Choices but now its called the Simple Chores app. The addressable market for my app is an American family with children who are old enough to have a phone, probably between 10 and 17 years old.
